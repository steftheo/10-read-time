          <p>Born and bred in England, Lua Cooper spent the first years of her career in politics before venturing out into the wild world of tech startups. Prior to joining The Iron Yard as the
            <a href="https://www.theironyard.com/locations/london.html" target="_blank">Campus Director in London</a>, Lua was on the management team of the Swiss startup
            <a href="http://unleash12.com/" target="_blank">Unleash 12</a>
            as their VP of Sales and also worked for
            <a href="https://www.groupon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Groupon</a>, helping run Groupon National &amp; Goods. Lua first came across The Iron Yard while on a solo road trip around the U.S. meeting with startups, which she successfully completed without crashing or getting sick of Taylor Swift’s album.&nbsp;<span id="more-4071"></span>

            and the London team recently celebrated the campus’s&nbsp;first Demo Day and graduation. “We were pleased at how many people from the industry showed up,” Lua said. “The feedback was also fantastic. We had some very&nbsp;popular apps, including a
            football app and an architect recruitment site. One student was offered a job even before graduation!”</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/artemy" target="_blank">Art</a>, one of our fearless&nbsp;London instructors, had this to say about working with Lua: “Lua lifts the mood of the campus.&nbsp;For instructors who teach, it might be tough to come in every
            morning at 9:00am after travelling in a packed&nbsp;Tube for 30 mins. But knowing that Lua will be there on campus waiting for you makes the whole trip a hell of a lot easier!”</p>
          <p>We recently sat down with Lua to chat a bit more about her role.</p>

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">I was looking for a new startup to dedicate myself to, but I was particularly keen to build something from the ground up again (like we did at Groupon).
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a massive shortage of dev tech talent in the UK, and with an ever growing startup scene I wanted to be part of the movement to facilitate it. Seeing as TIY had just launched their first international campus,
              and as it is the biggest coding school in the world – it was the perfect mix between startups, tech and building a super international arm!</span>

              and the students are now pestering me to do it every time! Ha!</span>

          <p>Leslie Brown grew up in Orlando with a grandfather who worked at the
            <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/" target="_blank">Kennedy Space Center</a>
            as a mechanical and systems engineer. As a kid, she often watched shuttles as they launched into space from Cape Canaveral. Excited and inspired by space travel, she ended up studying aerospace engineering at
            <a href="http://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>&nbsp;(MIT). After graduating, she worked as a systems engineer for a defense contractor,

            she says Lockheed Martin was a great place to start her career, it was not a great culture fit for her. She really wanted to work with a smaller company, with less red tape and the ability to see a project through from start to finish. So after
            leaving Lockheed Martin and teaching high school math for a year and a half, she did simulation work at another company using C++ knowledge she’d learned on-the-job at Lockheed Martin. This solidified her desire to learn web development and led to an
            extensive research phase.</p>
          <p>“I am a Google fiend,” she said, referring to the hours spent discovering the most relevant and in-demand web development languages and how she could learn enough to transition her career. She found she could teach herself online, or do a
            part-time, mentored program, but she knew based on her university days that immersive learning was the best route for her.</p>
          <p>“Thinking about my days in college, the times that I thrived the most and that I really felt like I was learning and making a lot of progress in a short period of time were the times where it was like you’re drinking through the fire hose. You’re
            with a group of people, it’s every day, it’s really intense, you’ve always got something to do, you’re always moving forward, there’s accountability.”</p>
          <p>So when she found The Iron Yard, which was located only a few miles from her home, it felt like exactly what she was looking for — except for one thing: the next Ruby on Rails class wasn’t starting for several months. She decided to wait for the
            next class at The Iron Yard. In the meantime, she got married and traveled extensively around South America with her husband, Pedro, who has since graduated from The Iron Yard’s Mobile Engineering with iOS program. She happily proclaims that it was
            worth the wait.</p>
          <p>“I’m really glad that I waited,” she said. “It has 100 percent turned out the way I wanted — like even better.”</p>
          <p>She describes her cohort of classmates as “a really good mix” with a variety of levels of knowledge from people who had done some programming before and some who were just starting out.</p>
          <p>“The questions that someone who had never written code before in their life would ask might be stuff I had never stopped to think about before, and they were good questions,” said Leslie, who enjoyed being a part of a team that helped each other
            push forward. “It was fun to answer questions and give secondary explanations and draw stuff out on white boards to solidify concepts. I found that when I explained things to other people, it really, really helped me. If you can explain it to
            someone, you really understand it.”</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">As a former teacher, she respected her instructor Brian’s ability to guide self-learning. “When you asked questions, he would never give you the answer straight out.” He’d ask questions such as:
            </span>
            <i>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">What about this? Did you think about this?</span>
            </i>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
              &nbsp;“You would go through the problem-solving process on your own, but you wouldn’t just hit a wall,” she explained.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came time to do her final project, she loved being able to create a practical web app from scratch applying everything she’d learned the past nine weeks. “It was awesome. It was just really satisfying to plan
              something out and see it through to the end.” It gave her confidence to see how the pieces of information she’d learned all fit together and to figure out how to join the pieces she didn’t yet know how to combine.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating in August 2015, she was hired by a startup, Modernmeal, three weeks later through a connection she’d made on campus at The Iron Yard. She now works out of the coworking space across the hall from The
              Iron Yard when she’s not working from home.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie laughs about a recent conversation she had with her mother, where she’d expressed excitement about her ability to still work and stay connected with her projects if she goes on vacation. Her mother was baffled
              at Leslie’s desire to work while on vacation, but for Leslie it makes sense. She finally loves what she’s doing.</span>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                “I love my job so much right now it’s crazy,” she said. “I never thought I’d like a job this much.”</span>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked where she sees herself in five years, she acknowledges her horizons have expanded exponentially. Ideas like starting her own business, which never occurred to her before, now dance in the back of her mind.
              Although she doesn’t have specific visions for where she sees herself in the future, she thinks that’s probably a good thing. She doesn’t have to look toward her future career as much anymore since she’s so content with where it is right now.</span>
